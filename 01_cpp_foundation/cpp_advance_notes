//Overall Concepts C++ memory model
Stack vs heap
Object lifetime
Padding & alignment
POD vs non-POD
sizeof, alignof

memory_layout.cpp
    sizeof
    Stack vs heap
    Object contiguity

padding_alignment.cpp
    Padding & alignment
    Cache lines and performance (cache misses/friendliness)


Concurrency & Memory Model (C++11–17)
    Data races
    Atomics
    False sharing
    Lock-free basics
    Cache coherence

Next for week#2 - 
API parameter design rules
    take by value
    take by const&
    take by T&&
    pass ownership vs borrow

std::span and non-owning views
    why it exists
    why pointer+size is weaker
    how it enforces contracts
Const + move interactions
    why const T&& is almost useless
    why const disables moves
Triviality & standard-layout
    why embedded cares
    DMA, IPC, serialization safety
